# AI Assistant Context for Audius API Integration Project

## Project Overview
This project involves integrating the Audius API into a LangChain-based application. The goal is to create a robust SDK that allows for seamless interaction with Audius services, particularly focusing on search functionalities for users, playlists, and tracks. The project also aims to incorporate this SDK into a LangChain agent for more complex, AI-driven interactions with the Audius platform.

## Current Focus
- Finalizing the langchainIntegration.test.ts file to ensure proper integration between the AudiusAPI and LangChain agents.
- Resolving deprecation warnings and import issues related to recent changes in LangChain's agent structures.
- Implementing and testing error handling in the LangChain integration.

## Key Components
1. AudiusAPI Class (audiusAPI.ts): Main class for interacting with the Audius API.
2. Utility Functions (audiusUtils.ts): Helper functions, including retryWithBackoff for API calls.
3. Custom Error Classes (audiusErrors.ts): Specific error types for Audius API interactions.
4. Type Definitions (audiusTypes.ts): TypeScript interfaces for Audius data structures.
5. Constants (audiusConstants.ts): API endpoints, rate limits, and other constant values.

## Recent Developments
- Successfully implemented and tested user and playlist search functionalities.
- Encountered and worked through various deprecation issues with LangChain's agent types.
- Shifted from using deprecated agent types (like ChatAgent) to more current ones (like OpenAIAgent).
- Implemented mocking strategies for testing LangChain integration without making actual API calls.

## Testing
### Current Test Files
- userSearch.test.ts: Tests for user search functionality.
- playlistSearch.test.ts: Tests for playlist search functionality.
- langchainIntegration.test.ts: Tests for integrating AudiusAPI with LangChain agents.

### Testing Challenges
- Keeping up with LangChain's evolving API and deprecations in agent structures.
- Properly mocking LangChain components for isolated testing of the Audius integration.
- Ensuring comprehensive error handling and edge case coverage in tests.

## Langchain Integration
The integration process involves creating an OpenAIAgent that uses the AudiusAPI as a tool. Current challenges include adapting to recent changes in LangChain's agent structures and ensuring proper typing and mocking in the test environment.

## Next Steps
1. Finalize and validate the langchainIntegration.test.ts file.
2. Implement additional test cases for error handling and edge scenarios.
3. Consider creating integration tests that simulate real-world usage scenarios.
4. Review and update documentation for all components.
5. Explore potential enhancements to the AudiusAPI class based on testing insights.

## Questions and Considerations
- Are there any specific Audius API features we should prioritize for integration beyond the current scope?
- How can we best structure the SDK to allow for easy updates as the Audius API evolves?
- What additional LangChain agent types or structures should we consider for future compatibility?
