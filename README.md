# Claudius

Audius gets an oracle. 

Currently uses ChatGPT but the bad pun is irresistable, so this is getting implemented with Anthropic's claude-3.5.

Claudius is a chatbot that provides insight into data on the Audius platform. Artists, labels, music lovers, and anyone with a passion for finding ways to champion music on the blockchain will be able to ask questions to a friendly expert with insights on what's making waves on the platform. While I can't commit to funding the project at scale (or at all), I do want to make this application easy to extend with far more in-depth analysis and involved orchestration than it will perform at launch. The analytics I do include will take Audius's lower absolute average play counts into account and use algorithms more appropriate for measuring the site's small but enthusiastic active user base.

I'm building this on top of the open-source Langchain template for Next.js from a few of the brilliant folks at Vercel, and I highly recommend that anyone else diving into making AI web applications checks it out, along with the other AI-focused project templates the teams over there have been putting out in recent months.
